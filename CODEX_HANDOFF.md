# Codex Handoff

Last updated: 2026-05-06 Asia/Taipei

## Current User Intent

The user wants to continue this project across computers. GitHub should carry both code and concise Codex handoff notes.

The latest clarified product direction: this should become a mobile web version of the existing LINE bot, not a separate dashboard. The existing LINE Flex card UI and information density are important and must stay canonical. The mobile site should let users open a URL and see everything the LINE card provides, plus deeper K-bar, watchlist, warrant, performance, status, and related detail views.

## Required Handoff Rule

At the end of every meaningful Codex session, update this file before committing/pushing if there was any design discussion, implementation decision, code change, blocker, or next-step decision.

Each update should include:

- What was changed or discussed.
- Which files were touched.
- What was intentionally not changed.
- Verification performed or skipped.
- The recommended next prompt for continuing on another computer.

Then commit and push the handoff update to GitHub so another computer can continue by reading this file first.

## Repositories Discussed

- `JustinFang1019/justin-trading-bot-web`: current web prototype repo cloned on this computer at `C:\Users\Siriu\Documents\justin-trading-bot-web`.
- `JustinFang1019/justin-trading-bot`: fuller private LINE trading bot repo. It contains the real LINE webhook, scanner, strategies, Flex card builders, cache, schedules, warrant modules, and Google Sheets persistence.

## Current Project State

`justin-trading-bot-web` is a static/mobile web prototype. It already has:

- `index.html` single-page UI.
- Scan list, warrants, ETF rebalance observation, alerts, admin status, LINE preview, and mobile layout.
- `data/market-snapshot.json` and `data/kbar-snapshot.json` generated from public market sources.
- `.github/workflows/update-market-data.yml` to update snapshots on weekdays.

It is not yet a real backend or LINE/LIFF app.

## Important Constraint From User

The user's core LINE cards and strategy logic must not change. In particular, preserve behavior from the fuller LINE bot repo:

- `stock_scanner/patterns.py` strategy logic, including START, CONT, KD convergence, RS ranking, pattern classification, thresholds, and scoring behavior.
- `stock_scanner/notify.py` core Flex card builders and strategy card content.
- Existing command meanings and LINE interaction flows unless explicitly approved.

The mobile/web redesign should wrap, preview, filter, and navigate around the existing outputs, not rewrite trading logic.

## Product Direction

Build a mobile-first companion interface for the existing LINE bot:

- Keep LINE as push/summary and keep existing small cards as canonical.
- Add Web/LIFF as a deeper mobile viewer for scan results, strategy details, K charts, warrant details, RS ranking, watchlist, performance tracking, and admin status.
- Prefer a thin API/export layer that reuses existing scan results, K-bar cache, warrant cache, and Google Sheets data.
- Treat the old static web prototype as visual direction, then connect it to real data from `justin-trading-bot`.

## Implemented So Far

In `justin-trading-bot-web`:

- Rewrote `index.html` as a mobile-first companion viewer.
- Added bottom navigation: Today, Detail, Warrants, Status, LINE.
- Added filters for market, START/CONT, RS 90+, score, BOX, and repeat selections.
- Added a mobile detail view with chart, A/B/C entry layers, stop, pressure, and LINE preview.
- Added `docs/mobile-redesign-proposal.md`.
- Added `docs/web-version-integration-plan.md`.
- Fixed LINE preview direction after user feedback: the web app must not invent a different LINE card format. Future work should consume real Flex JSON from the bot instead of recreating cards by hand.
- Started replacing prototype data with live original bot data in `index.html`.
  - `API_BASE` currently points to `https://stock-scanner-bot-f3kt.onrender.com/api/web`.
  - `GET /api/web/scan-results` now populates the main stock list.
  - Selecting a stock loads `/stock/<id>/card`, `/stock/<id>/kbar`, and `/stock/<id>/warrants`.
  - LINE preview now prefers canonical Flex JSON returned by the bot API, with the bot text summary below it.
  - Prototype data remains as fallback if the API is unavailable.
- Adjusted the web UI direction toward scan-card-first behavior.
  - The Today list now renders scan-style cards instead of a generic dashboard row.
  - Flex/card buttons are clickable in the web UI.
  - `K線` switches to the internal K-bar card drawn from the bot `/kbar` cache, with Yahoo retained only as an external backup link.
  - `權證` switches to the warrant card, `財報` opens the financial page, `即時` and `回測` route to web-side read-only views, and `+自選` is held until authenticated write/LIFF is added.
- Rebuilt `index.html` again after user feedback that old prototype data still appeared.
  - The page is now a mobile-first LINE scan-card browser rather than a dashboard.
  - Removed the built-in fake stock fallback from runtime by resetting `stocks = []` and loading only live `/api/web/scan-results`.
  - If API loading fails, the page shows an API error instead of showing fake 2330/3491/2327 data.
  - Bottom navigation is now 小卡 / K線 / 權證 / 狀態.
  - Backend status view remains because the user liked that feature.
- Updated the design again after user clarified Today must match the original scan card.
  - Added `GET /api/web/scan-cards` in `justin-trading-bot` so the backend returns the whole `notify.py build_flex_message()` carousel in one API call.
  - `justin-trading-bot-web` Today view now renders those original Flex bubbles directly.
  - `/api/web/scan-results` remains for search/filter metadata and extended detail pages, but it is no longer the source used to reconstruct the Today cards.
  - PR #4 (`Expose scan flex cards API`) was opened and merged into `justin-trading-bot` main.
  - Render was still returning 404 for `/api/web/scan-cards` shortly after merge, so Render likely needs `Manual Deploy -> Deploy latest commit` or more time for auto deploy.

In `justin-trading-bot`:

- Added a conservative read-only API layer on branch `codex/web-readonly-api` and pushed it to GitHub.
- Branch URL: `https://github.com/JustinFang1019/justin-trading-bot/tree/codex/web-readonly-api`
- Commit: `18bf59c Add read-only web API endpoints`
- Files touched there: `app.py`, `stock_scanner/web_api.py`
- Existing LINE webhook, schedulers, strategy logic, push/reply commands, and Google Sheets write flows were intentionally not changed.

Read-only API endpoints now available on that branch:

- `GET /api/web/health`
- `GET /api/web/scan-results`
- `GET /api/web/stock/<stock_id>`
- `GET /api/web/stock/<stock_id>/kbar?limit=180`
- `GET /api/web/stock/<stock_id>/card`
- `GET /api/web/stock/<stock_id>/warrants`
- `GET /api/web/performance`
- `GET /api/web/watchlist`
- `GET /api/web/rs/top?limit=20`
- `GET /api/web/status`

Important implementation notes:

- `/api/web/stock/<stock_id>/card` calls the original `stock_scanner.notify.build_flex_message()` and `build_message()`, so the web version can consume canonical LINE card output instead of hand-recreating the small card.
- `/api/web/stock/<stock_id>/kbar` reads existing `/data/kbar` disk cache through the bot's existing loader.
- `/api/web/stock/<stock_id>/warrants` reads existing Top 3 warrant disk cache and does not trigger a fresh warrant calculation.
- `WEB_API_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` can restrict CORS; if unset, the read-only API currently returns `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.

## Verification

- Reviewed diffs and route wiring in the original bot repo.
- Confirmed `app.py` only registers the new blueprint and does not change existing LINE bot behavior.
- Python syntax execution was skipped because this computer has only `py.exe` launcher and no installed Python interpreter available in PATH.
- Confirmed live Render API health returns OK.
- Confirmed live `scan-results` returns 30 records from the original bot.
- Confirmed live `/api/web/stock/6933/card` returns canonical Flex JSON and text summary.
- JavaScript syntax check with local `node` was attempted but blocked by Windows access denied in this environment.
- JavaScript syntax check was not rerun after the scan-card/button-routing update because local `node.exe` remains blocked in this environment.
- Confirmed live Render API still returns `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so GitHub Pages should be allowed to call it from the browser.
- The full rebuild has not been browser-verified yet after this edit; refresh GitHub Pages and check that first card is from live API, currently expected to start with `2355 敬鵬` for the 2026-05-05 scan payload.
- After the latest change, also verify `/api/web/scan-cards` is deployed on Render before expecting GitHub Pages to show original Flex cards. If 404 persists, manually deploy latest main on Render.

## Recommended Next Implementation Step

1. Open a PR from `codex/web-readonly-api` into the original bot repo main branch, test it on Render/staging, then merge only if the live bot remains stable.
2. Open the GitHub Pages URL and verify the mobile page shows the same scan candidates as LINE. It should not show the old prototype names like `2330 台積電` unless those are actually in live scan-results.
3. Improve the lightweight Flex renderer if spacing differs from LINE, but keep the data source as `/api/web/scan-cards`.
4. Add funnel and stale-data endpoints later if needed; they were not added in this first conservative API pass.
5. Add LIFF or authenticated write actions only after read-only mobile pages are correct.

## Next Prompt Suggestion

Ask Codex:

`請先閱讀 CODEX_HANDOFF.md，打開 GitHub Pages 檢查 justin-trading-bot-web 是否已顯示原 LINE bot 的 scan-results；如果小卡渲染和 LINE 還有落差，請優先改善 Flex JSON renderer，不要改原 bot 策略。`
